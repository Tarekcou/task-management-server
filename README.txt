# Task Management Backend

This is the backend for the Task Management application, built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The backend provides RESTful APIs for managing tasks, projects, user authentication, and real-time synchronization.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v14+)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) or a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account for a cloud database
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) (for authentication)

PORT=5000                    # Port to run the server on
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/task-management # MongoDB URI (for local or Atlas)
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret   # Secret key for signing JWT tokens
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key # Firebase API key for authentication
API Endpoints
Authentication
POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user
POST /api/auth/login: Login with email and password
POST /api/auth/logout: Logout the user (invalidate the JWT)
Task Management
GET /api/tasks: Get all tasks for the authenticated user
POST /api/tasks: Create a new task
GET /api/tasks/:id: Get a task by ID
PUT /api/tasks/:id: Update a task by ID
DELETE /api/tasks/:id: Delete a task by ID
Project Management
GET /api/projects: Get all projects for the authenticated user
POST /api/projects: Create a new project
GET /api/projects/:id: Get a project by ID
PUT /api/projects/:id: Update a project by ID
DELETE /api/projects/:id: Delete a project by ID
Category Management
GET /api/categories: Get all categories (To-Do, In Progress, Done)
PUT /api/tasks/:id/category: Update the category of a task
Real-time Synchronization
The backend uses Socket.IO for real-time task synchronization across multiple clients. When a task is created, updated, or deleted, all connected clients will receive an updated list of tasks.

WebSocket Events
taskCreated: Sent when a new task is created.
taskUpdated: Sent when a task is updated.
taskDeleted: Sent when a task is deleted.
Testing
You can use Postman or any other API testing tool to test the endpoints. Make sure to pass the JWT token for protected routes.
